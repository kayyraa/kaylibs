"""
# Binary Counting:
To perform binary counting, you can utilize the `count()` function by specifying the following arguments: `start`, `end`, `delay`, and `stroke`. An example usage of this function would look like: `binary.count(0, 10, 0, 0.25)`.

# Boolean Values:
In the realm of binary boolean values, we assign `True` to represent 1 and `False` to represent 0. This binary representation, such as `1010001`, allows you to transmit signals in binary format to various devices. This method facilitates communication with compatible devices, especially if the device's hardware is not outdated.
